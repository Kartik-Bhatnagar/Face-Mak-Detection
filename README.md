Object Detection

Object detection is commonly confused with image recognition. -> Image recognition assigns a label to an image.
A picture of a car receives the label “dog”. A picture of two dogs, still receives the label “dog”. -> 
Object detection, on the other hand, draws a box around each dog and labels the box “dog”. The model predicts where each 
object is and what label should be applied. In that way, object detection provides more information about an image than recognition.
